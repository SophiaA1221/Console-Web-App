        A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor
        provides the output and the keyboard is used for input.

        While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a
        system used to control one or more servers. Early consoles in the 1970s and 1980s provided a text-only "command
        line" interface, in which a network admin could type commands at a command prompt. Modern consoles often provide
        a graphical interface that can be used to control machines on a local network or provide remote access to remote
        systems. These consoles typically include a mouse for navigating graphical interfaces.</p>
